For the development of the application, we utilized Flask, a python framework to handle backend operations, including routing and integration with MySQL for database management. The frontend was designed using HTML enhanced with Bootstrap for responsive design and user-friendly interface elements, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user experience across various devices. JavaScript, along with jQuery, was employed to add interactivity, such as form submissions and modal dialogs.
